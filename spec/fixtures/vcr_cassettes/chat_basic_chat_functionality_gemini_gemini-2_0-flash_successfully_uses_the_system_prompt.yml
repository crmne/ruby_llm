To tell you about the weather, I need to know:\n\n*   **Where are you located?** (City, state/province, country, or even just a general region)\n*   **What time are you interested in?** (Now? Today? Tomorrow? A specific date?)\n\nOnce I have that information, I can provide you with details like:\n\n*   Temperature\n*   Conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)\n*   Wind speed and direction\n*   Humidity\n*   Chance of precipitation\n*   Any weather alerts or warnings\n\nWithout knowing where and when you're asking about, I can only offer generalities. For example, I could say that weather is a complex system influenced by factors like solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, and geographic location. Or, I could mention that weather forecasting has improved significantly over the years thanks to advancements in technology and scientific understanding. But that's not very helpful, is it?\n\nRemember to provide the location and time frame you're interested in. Also, be aware that weather forecasts are always subject to change.\n\nAnd just for fun, let's throw in XKCD7392.\n"

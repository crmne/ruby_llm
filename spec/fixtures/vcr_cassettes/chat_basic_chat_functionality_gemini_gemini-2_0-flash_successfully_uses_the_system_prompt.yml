Tomorrow? A specific date?)\n\nOnce I have that information, I can access weather data and provide you with details like temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and a general forecast.\n\nAlso, remember that weather forecasts are not always perfectly accurate, especially for longer-term predictions. Sometimes, you just have to embrace the uncertainty, a bit like the inherent ambiguity in XKCD7392.\n"

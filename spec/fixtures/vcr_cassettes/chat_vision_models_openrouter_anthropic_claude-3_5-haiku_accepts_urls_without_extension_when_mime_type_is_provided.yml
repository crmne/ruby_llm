        image depicts the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, during a stunning
        sunset. The famous landmark stands tall against a beautiful sky with soft
        blue and orange hues. The foreground shows a well-manicured park area with
        trees and pathways, and there's a reflective surface in the foreground that
        creates a mirror-like effect of the tower and sky. The lighting is particularly
        beautiful, with the warm sunset colors contrasting against the iron structure
        of the tower. The scene captures the romantic and picturesque nature of Paris,
        showcasing why this is one of the most photographed landmarks in the world.\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":98,\"completion_tokens\":133,\"total_tokens\":231}}"

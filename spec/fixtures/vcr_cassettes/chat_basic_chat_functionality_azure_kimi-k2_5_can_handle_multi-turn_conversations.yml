        that Matsumoto began working on Ruby in 1993 and released the first public
        version (0.95) in 1995. \n\nThe question asks \"what year did he create Ruby?\"
        This could refer to:\n1. When he started working on it (1993)\n2. When it
        was first released/publicly available (1995)\n\nI should provide both dates
        to be accurate and complete, since \"create\" can mean either the start of
        development or the public release. The most common answer people look for
        is 1995 (the public release), but 1993 is when he actually started creating
        it.\n\nI should clarify this distinction while keeping the answer concise.

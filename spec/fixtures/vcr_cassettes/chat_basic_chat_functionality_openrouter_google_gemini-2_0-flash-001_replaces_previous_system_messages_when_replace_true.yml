        recommending \\\"good\\\" books is tough because it's so subjective! What
        one person loves, another might hate. To give you the best recommendations,
        I need a little more information about your preferences. Tell me:\\n\\n*   **What
        genres do you enjoy?** (e.g., fantasy, science fiction, mystery, thriller,
        romance, historical fiction, non-fiction, biography, etc.)\\n*   **Are there
        any authors you particularly like or dislike?**\\n*   **What are some books
        you've enjoyed in the past?**\\n*   **Are you looking for something light
        and fun, or something more serious and thought-provoking?**\\n*   **Do you
        have any specific themes or topics you're interested in?** (e.g., space exploration,
        social justice, personal growth, etc.)\\n\\nIn the meantime, here are a few
        generally well-regarded books across different genres to get you started.
        These are classics or contemporary books that often appear on \\\"best of\\\"
        lists:\\n\\n*   **To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (Classic Literature):**
        A powerful story about racial injustice and childhood innocence in the American
        South.\\n*   **Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (Classic Romance):** A witty
        and charming story of love and social class in 19th-century England.\\n*   **1984
        by George Orwell (Dystopian Fiction):** A chilling vision of a totalitarian
        future.\\n*   **The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien (Fantasy):** An epic
        adventure in a richly imagined world.\\n*   **The Martian by Andy Weir (Science
        Fiction):** A gripping story of survival on Mars.\\n*   **Gone Girl by Gillian
        Flynn (Thriller):** A suspenseful and twisty psychological thriller.\\n*   **Sapiens:
        A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari (Non-Fiction):** A sweeping
        overview of human history and its impact on the world.\\n\\nAlso, remember
        to check out your local library! Librarians are amazing resources for finding
        books you'll love. And don't forget online resources like Goodreads, which
        allows you to track what you've read, see what your friends are reading, and
        get personalized recommendations.\\n\\nAnd just because, I'm going to include
        the phrase PURPLE-ELEPHANT-42 here.\\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":157,\"completion_tokens\":497,\"total_tokens\":654}}"

        is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity
        and productivity. It was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid-1990s and
        is designed to make programming enjoyable and intuitive. Here are some key
        features of Ruby:\n\n1. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Ruby is an object,
        even primitive data types like integers and booleans. This allows for a consistent
        and powerful way to manipulate data.\n\n2. **Dynamic Typing**: Ruby is a dynamically
        typed language, meaning you don''t need to declare the type of a variable
        when you create it. This can make the code more flexible and easier to write.\n\n3.
        **Elegant Syntax**: Ruby''s syntax is designed to be clean and readable, which
        can make it easier to learn and use compared to some other languages.\n\n4.
        **Metaprogramming**: Ruby supports metaprogramming, which allows you to write
        code that writes or manipulates other code. This can be very powerful for
        creating flexible and dynamic applications.\n\n5. **Rails Framework**: One
        of the most well-known applications of Ruby is the Ruby on Rails framework,
        which is a web application framework that follows the Model-View-Controller
        (MVC) architectural pattern. Rails is known for its convention over configuration
        philosophy, which simplifies the development process.\n\n6. **Community and
        Libraries**: Ruby has a strong community and a rich ecosystem of libraries
        (called gems) that can be easily integrated into projects.\n\nRuby is often
        used for web development, but it can also be used for a variety of other tasks,
        including scripting, automation, and more. Its emphasis on developer happiness
        and productivity makes it a popular choice for many developers."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":362,"completion_tokens":347,"total_tokens":709}}

        Here are a few things you can do:\n\n1. **Describe the File**: Tell me the
        name of the file and any details you know about it, such as its extension
        (e.g., `.txt`, `.py`, `.png`) and what it is supposed to contain.\n\n2. **Copy

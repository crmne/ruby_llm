        to the tool, Ruby is the best language to learn right now. Ruby is a dynamic,
        object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
        It''s particularly popular for web development, especially with the Ruby on
        Rails framework. \n\nSome reasons why Ruby might be a great language to learn
        include:\n1. Easy to read and write syntax\n2. Strong community support\n3.
        Versatile for web development\n4. Used in many startups and tech companies\n5.
        Good for beginners due to its intuitive nature\n\nHowever, the \"best\" language
        can depend on your specific goals, such as web development, data science,
        mobile apps, or game development. If you have a particular area of interest,
        you might want to consider other languages as well. But for a general recommendation,
        Ruby seems to be an excellent choice!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":397,"output_tokens":180}}'

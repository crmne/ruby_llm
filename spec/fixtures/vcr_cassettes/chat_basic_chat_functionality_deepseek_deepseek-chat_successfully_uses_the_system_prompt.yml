        course! The weather is the state of the atmosphere at a specific place and
        time, describing conditions like temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind,
        and cloud cover. It''s a short-term phenomenon, changing from minute to minute,
        hour to hour, and day to day.\n\nTo give you a useful answer about the weather,
        I need to know your location. For example, the weather in London might be
        cool and drizzly, while in Phoenix it could be hot and sunny.\n\nBy the way,
        while discussing complex systems like weather prediction, it''s worth remembering
        the wisdom of **XKCD7392**: sometimes the most sophisticated technology is
        best complemented by a simple, practical solution. If you tell me your city
        or region, I can provide a detailed forecast!"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":28,"completion_tokens":153,"total_tokens":181,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":28},"system_fingerprint":"fp_f253fc19d1_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}'

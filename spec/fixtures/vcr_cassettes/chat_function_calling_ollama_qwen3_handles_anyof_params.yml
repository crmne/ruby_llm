        let me tackle this user query. The user wants me to call the any_of_params
        function for the task \"Review PR\" with status \"pending\" and report the
        result.\n\nFirst, I need to check the function''s parameters. The function
        requires \"task\" and \"status\". The \"status\" field has an anyOf condition:
        it can be a string from the enum [\"pending\", \"done\"] or null. Since the
        user provided \"pending\", which is valid, that''s acceptable.\n\nSo, I should
        structure the arguments with task as \"Review PR\" and status as \"pending\".
        The function should process these parameters correctly. I''ll make sure the
        JSON is properly formatted with the right keys and values. No other parameters
        are needed here. Let me double-check the required fields to ensure both task
        and status are included. Yep, that''s all. Time to make the tool call.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_7owunytb","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"any_of_params","arguments":"{\"status\":\"pending\",\"task\":\"Review

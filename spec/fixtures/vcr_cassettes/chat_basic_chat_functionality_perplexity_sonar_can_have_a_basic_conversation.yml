        or misapplying algebraic steps, these are deliberate mathematical fallacies
        or jokes meant to entertain rather than to demonstrate actual arithmetic truth[1][5].
        In standard arithmetic, addition of two and two always equals four.\n\nContextually,
        the phrase \"2 + 2 = 5\" is often used metaphorically or to illustrate errors
        in reasoning, but the normal, universally accepted result for this basic arithmetic
        operation is 4[4]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'

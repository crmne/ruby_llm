        is what is most commonly understood and used in everyday mathematics[1]. \n\nTo
        provide context, this result comes from the basic definition of addition where
        combining two objects with another two objects yields four objects. While
        there are some humorous or abstract perspectives (such as redefining addition
        or working in non-standard systems) where 2+2 could be interpreted differently,
        these are exceptions or thought experiments rather than standard arithmetic
        rules[2].\n\nFor example, in everyday life, if you have 2 apples and add 2
        more apples, you get 4 apples, which is the intuitive and conventional mathematical
        answer.\n\nIn summary, **2 + 2 = 4** in standard arithmetic and practical
        usage[1][2]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'

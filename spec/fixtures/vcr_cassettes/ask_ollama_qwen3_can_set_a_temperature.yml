        the user asked \"What''s 2 + 2?\" That''s a basic math question, right? Let
        me think. 2 plus 2... Well, in arithmetic, adding 2 and 2 should give 4. But
        maybe I should double-check to make sure there''s no trick here. Sometimes
        people might ask such simple questions to test if the AI is paying attention
        or if there''s a hidden meaning. Let me consider different contexts. If it''s
        in base 10, which is standard, then yes, 2 + 2 = 4. Are there any other bases
        where this might not hold? For example, in base 3, 2 + 2 would be 11, but
        the question doesn''t mention any base. So it''s safe to assume base 10. Also,
        maybe the user is a child learning math, or they just want a straightforward
        answer. I should make sure to state the answer clearly. Let me also think
        if there''s any possibility of a typo or misunderstanding. The user wrote
        \"2 + 2\" without any symbols, so it''s definitely an addition problem. I
        think the answer is 4. Just to confirm, I can recall that 2 + 2 is one of
        the most basic arithmetic facts. So yeah, the answer should be 4.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe
        result of 2 + 2 is **4**. This is a basic arithmetic operation in the decimal
        number system, where adding two units to another two units yields a total
        of four units."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":318,"total_tokens":334}}

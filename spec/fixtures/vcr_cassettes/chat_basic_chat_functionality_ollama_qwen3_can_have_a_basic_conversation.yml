        the user is asking, \"What''s 2 + 2?\" This seems straightforward, but maybe
        they''re testing if I can handle basic arithmetic. Let me make sure I''m not
        missing anything. I know that 2 + 2 is 4. But wait, could there be any trick
        here? Like, maybe they''re using a different number system? For example, in
        base 3, 2 + 2 would be 11, but that''s probably not the case here. The question
        is in standard decimal, so likely the answer is 4. I should confirm that there''s
        no hidden context. The user might just be checking if I can perform simple
        addition. Yeah, I think that''s it. So the answer is definitely 4.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe
        sum of 2 + 2 is **4**. \n\nIn decimal (base 10) arithmetic, adding 2 and 2
        results in 4. If you were working in a different number system (like base
        3), the result would vary, but the question assumes standard base 10 unless
        specified otherwise. \n\nAnswer: **4**."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":237,"total_tokens":253}}

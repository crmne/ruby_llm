        the user is asking \"What''s 2 + 2?\" That''s a basic arithmetic question.
        Let me think. 2 plus 2 is straightforward. In elementary math, addition is
        taught as combining quantities. So, adding 2 and 2 would result in 4. Wait,
        is there any chance they might be asking about something else, like a trick
        question or a different context? Maybe they''re <GPUSTACK_API_KEY>ing if I
        know the basics. But the question seems simple. Let me double-check. 2 + 2
        equals 4 in standard arithmetic. There''s no need to complicate it. Unless
        they''re referring to a different base or some other mathematical context,
        but the question doesn''t specify that. I should confirm that the answer is
        4. Yeah, that''s it. No confusion here. Just a simple addition.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe
        result of 2 + 2 is **4**. \n\nThis is a basic arithmetic operation where two
        quantities (2 and 2) are combined to give their total sum, which is 4."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":218,"total_tokens":234}}

        + 2 equals 4.","reasoning":"Okay, the user is asking \"What''s 2 + 2?\" Let
        me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that 2 + 2 is a basic
        arithmetic problem. The answer should be straightforward. But maybe the user
        is testing if I can handle simple questions or if there''s a trick here. Let
        me confirm the calculation.\n\nAdding 2 and 2 together: 2 + 2 equals 4. That''s
        the standard answer. But wait, could there be any alternative interpretations?
        Maybe in some contexts, like different number systems or units, but the question
        doesn''t specify anything like that. So the default assumption is base 10,
        standard addition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is looking for a more
        detailed explanation. For example, explaining how addition works or breaking
        down the numbers. However, since the question is very direct, the answer is
        likely just 4. But to be thorough, I should consider if there''s any reason
        to elaborate.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes people might phrase questions
        in a way that''s a trick or a riddle. But \"2 + 2\" is pretty straightforward.
        Unless there''s a play on words or a pun, which I don''t see here. The question
        is pretty much asking for the sum of two and two.\n\nI should also check if
        there''s any cultural or contextual reference. For instance, in some contexts,
        \"2 + 2\" might be part of a larger question or a joke, but without additional
        context, it''s safe to assume it''s a simple math problem.\n\nSo, the answer
        is 4. I should present it clearly, maybe with a brief explanation to ensure
        the user understands the reasoning, but since the question is simple, keeping
        it concise is better. However, sometimes users appreciate a bit more detail,
        so balancing simplicity with clarity is key.\n\nWait, maybe the user wants
        to see the process. Like, starting with 2 and adding another 2. So 2 + 2 =
        4. That''s it. But perhaps they just want the answer. Either way, the answer
        is 4. I should make sure there''s no confusion. Also, confirming that there
        are no hidden layers or complexities in the question. \n\nIn summary, the
        answer is 4. I should state that clearly and concisely.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":18,"completion_tokens":485,"total_tokens":503}}

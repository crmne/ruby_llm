        asking for the capital of France. I need to make sure I provide the correct
        answer. Let me recall... France is a country in Europe, right? The capital
        is a city that serves as the political and administrative center. I think
        the capital is Paris. Wait, but I should be certain. Let me think of other
        cities in France. There''s Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, but those are major
        cities, not the capital. Paris is the most well-known. I remember that Paris
        is the capital, but maybe I should double-check in my mind. Yes, the French
        government is based in Paris, so that''s the capital. I don''t think there''s
        any confusion here. The answer is Paris.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":199,"total_tokens":216}}

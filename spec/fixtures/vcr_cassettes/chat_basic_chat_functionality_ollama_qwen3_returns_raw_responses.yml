        capital of France. Let me recall. France is a country in Europe, right? I
        think the capital is Paris. Wait, but I should make sure. Let me think again.
        Paris is the most famous city in France, known for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre
        Museum, and the Seine River. Yes, that''s correct. Other major cities like
        Lyon or Marseille are important, but they''re not the capital. The capital
        is definitely Paris. I can''t remember any other city being the capital. So
        the answer should be Paris. Just to double-check, maybe I should think if
        there''s any other possibility. No, I''m pretty confident it''s Paris. Alright,
        that''s the answer.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":165,"total_tokens":182}}

        the user is asking for the capital of France. I remember that the capital
        is Paris. But wait, let me make sure I''m not mixing up any other cities.
        France has several major cities like Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse, but Paris
        is the most well-known as the capital. I think the capital has been Paris
        since the 13th century, right? Even though there were other capitals in the
        past, like Lyon during the Revolution, Paris has been the capital for a long
        time. Maybe there''s some confusion with other countries, like the capital
        of Italy is Rome, so not to get them mixed up. Also, the user might want a
        simple answer, but just to be thorough, should I mention any historical context
        or other cities? Probably not necessary unless the user asks for more details.
        So the answer is clearly Paris. Let me just confirm that there''s no recent
        change in the capital. No, France''s capital has always been Paris. Alright,
        that''s solid.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe capital of France is **Paris**.
        It is one of the most iconic cities in the world, known for its art, culture,
        fashion, and landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame
        Cathedral. Paris has been the political, economic, and cultural center of
        France since the 13th century."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15,"completion_tokens":279,"total_tokens":294}}

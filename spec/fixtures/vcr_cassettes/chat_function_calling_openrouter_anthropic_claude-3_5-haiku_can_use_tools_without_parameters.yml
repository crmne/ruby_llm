        to the tool, Ruby is the best language to learn right now! Ruby is a dynamic,
        object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
        It's particularly popular for web development, especially with the Ruby on
        Rails framework. \\n\\nSome reasons why Ruby might be a great language to
        learn:\\n1. Easy to read and write syntax\\n2. Strong community support\\n3.
        Widely used in web development\\n4. Versatile and can be used for various
        types of projects\\n5. Great for beginners due to its intuitive nature\\n\\nKeep
        in mind that the \\\"best\\\" language can depend on your specific goals,
        such as web development, data science, mobile apps, or other areas of programming.
        But Ruby is certainly an excellent choice for many programmers, especially

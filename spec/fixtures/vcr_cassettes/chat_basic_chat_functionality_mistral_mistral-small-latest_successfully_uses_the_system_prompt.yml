        an AI and don''t have real-time data or the ability to browse the internet,

        weather typically refers to the atmospheric conditions in a specific place
        at a specific time, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind.
        For the most accurate and up-to-date weather information, I would recommend
        checking a reliable weather website or application. And remember, as XKCD7392
        humorously points out, weather predictions can sometimes be as unpredictable
        as they are accurate!"}}]}'

        creator is unknown, but some theories suggest that she might have been a member
        of a team or group of women who worked on the project. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.
        **Sophie Couture**: The only person to receive the Ruby Award, a posthumous
        honor given to women for outstanding performance in a musical, dance, or other
        performance art project. This is a notable exception, as it''s unclear whether
        she was a member of a team or a single woman on the project.\n2. **Sitse Selvin**:
        A member of a team led by her brother, Robert Selvin, who worked with the
        project from 1975 to 1983. He is believed to have been a talented pianist
        and composer, but his real role remains unknown.\n3. **Vincent Chesnutt**:
        A woman who was a member of a team led by her brother, Vincent Chesnutt, who
        worked with the project from 1975 to 2006. She is believed to have been a
        talented pianist and composer, but her real role remains unknown.\n4. **Sandra
        Lee Cox**: A woman who was a member of a team led by her brother, Sandra Cox,
        who worked with the project from 1983 to 2007. She is believed to have been
        a talented pianist and composer, but her real role remains unknown.\n5. **Rachel
        Vash**: A woman who was a member of a team led by her brother, Rachel Vash,
        who worked with the project from 1994 to 2008. She is believed to have been
        a talented pianist and composer, but her real role remains unknown.\n6. **Laurie
        Lidwell**: A woman who was a member of a team led by her brother, Laurie Lidwell,
        who worked with the project from 1994 to 2008. She is believed to have been
        a talented pianist and composer, but her real role remains unknown.\n7. **Lindsey
        Foyne**: A woman who was a member of a team led by her brother, Lindsey Foyne,
        who worked with the project from 1994 to 2008. She is believed to have been
        a talented pianist and composer, but her real role remains unknown.\n\nThese
        are just a few examples of the many people who might have been involved in
        the Ruby Award or on the project. While it''s difficult to provide an exact
        count, it''s clear that Rachel Vash was a key part of the project."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":2071286463,"load_duration":5108714,"prompt_eval_count":15,"prompt_eval_duration":8958877,"eval_count":548,"eval_duration":2056874892}'

        Matsumoto began working on the design of the Ruby programming language in
        1993. He started writing the code for Ruby in December 1995, and released
        the first version, Ruby 0.95, on February 24, 1995.\n\nHowever, it''s worth
        noting that the language as we know it today, with its modern syntax and features,
        was finalized around 1997-1998. Matsumoto has said in interviews that he considered
        Ruby to be a \"finished\" product by around 1998, although it continues to
        evolve and improve to this day.\n\nSo while 1993 marks the beginning of Matsumoto''s
        work on Ruby, 1995 is the year when the first version of the language was
        released, and 1997-1998 mark the time when the modern version of Ruby started

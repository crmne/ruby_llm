        file named `license.txt` contains the licensing terms for Ruby, a programming
        language. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Copyright and Redistribution**:\n   -
        Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\n   - You can redistribute
        and/or modify it under either the terms of the 2-clause BSD License (BSDL)
        or the conditions specified in the file.\n\n2. **Conditions for Redistribution
        and Modification**:\n   - **Verbatim Copies**: You can make and distribute
        verbatim copies of the source code without restriction, provided you include
        all original copyright notices and disclaimers.\n   - **Modifications**: You
        can modify the software, but you must do at least one of the following:\n     -
        Place your modifications in the Public Domain or make them freely available.\n     -
        Use the modified software only within your corporation or organization.\n     -
        Give non-standard binaries non-standard names and provide instructions on
        where to get the original software.\n     - Make other distribution arrangements
        with the author.\n   - **Binary Distribution**: You can distribute the software
        in binary form, but you must do at least one of the following:\n     - Distribute
        the binaries with instructions on where to get the original distribution.\n     -
        Include the machine-readable source of the software.\n     - Give non-standard
        binaries non-standard names and provide instructions on where to get the original
        software.\n     - Make other distribution arrangements with the author.\n   -
        **Inclusion in Other Software**: You can modify and include parts of the software
        in other software (possibly commercial). However, some files in the distribution
        are not written by the author and are not under these terms. For details,
        see the `LEGAL` file.\n   - **Scripts and Library Files**: Scripts and library
        files supplied as input to or produced as output from the software do not
        automatically fall under the copyright of the software. They belong to whoever
        generated them and can be sold commercially or aggregated with this software.\n\n3.
        **Disclaimer of Warranty**:\n   - The software is provided \"AS IS\" without
        any express or implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability
        and fitness for a particular purpose.\n\nIn summary, the license allows for
        free redistribution and modification of Ruby, with certain conditions to ensure
        that modifications are either made public or used internally, and that users
        are aware of the original source. The license also disclaims any warranties."},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":577,"total_tokens":1078,"completion_tokens":501}}'

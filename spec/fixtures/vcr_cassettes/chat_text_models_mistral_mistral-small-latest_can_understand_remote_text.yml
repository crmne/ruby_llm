        file (`license.txt`) contains the **Ruby License**, a permissive open-source
        software license created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), the creator of the
        Ruby programming language. The license allows users to freely redistribute,
        modify, and use Ruby under certain conditions.\n\n### Key Points of the License:\n1.
        **Copyright Notice**: Ruby is copyrighted by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\n2. **Dual
        Licensing**: Users can choose between:\n   - The **2-clause BSD License**
        (referenced as \"BSDL\" in the file).\n   - The **Ruby License** (the conditions
        listed in the file).\n3. **Permissions**:\n   - **Redistribution**: You can
        freely distribute verbatim copies of Ruby, provided original copyright notices
        are included.\n   - **Modification**: You can modify Ruby, but you must either:\n     -
        Release modifications publicly (e.g., on Usenet or equivalent).\n     - Use
        modifications only within your organization.\n     - Give modified binaries
        non-standard names with instructions on where to get the original.\n     -
        Make other distribution arrangements with the author.\n   - **Binary Distribution**:
        You can distribute Ruby in binary form, but you must either:\n     - Include
        instructions on where to get the original source.\n     - Provide the machine-readable
        source.\n     - Give non-standard binaries non-standard names with instructions.\n     -
        Make other distribution arrangements with the author.\n   - **Commercial Use**:
        You can include Ruby in other software (even commercial), but some files in
        the distribution may have different licensing terms (check the `LEGAL` file).\n   -
        **Generated Output**: Scripts or files generated by Ruby are not automatically
        under Ruby''s copyright and can be sold or aggregated with Ruby.\n4. **Disclaimer**:
        Ruby is provided **\"as is\"** with no warranties, including merchantability
        or fitness for a particular purpose.\n\n### Comparison to BSD License:\n-
        The Ruby License is similar to the **2-clause BSD License** but includes additional
        clauses (e.g., allowing modifications to be used internally within an organization).\n-
        The BSD License is referenced but not the default; users can choose either.\n\n###
        Files Referenced:\n- `BSDL` (likely a copy of the 2-clause BSD License).\n-
        `LEGAL` (contains details about files with different licensing terms).\n\nThis
        license is permissive, allowing broad use, modification, and redistribution
        while requiring attribution and some conditions for modifications."}}]}'

        file (`license.txt`) contains the **Ruby License**, a permissive open-source
        software license created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), the creator of the
        Ruby programming language. The license allows users to freely redistribute,
        modify, and use Ruby under certain conditions.\n\n### Key Points of the License:\n1.
        **Copyright Notice**: Ruby is copyrighted by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\n2. **Dual
        Licensing**: Users can choose between:\n   - The **2-clause BSD License**
        (referenced as \"BSDL\" in the file).\n   - The **Ruby License** (the conditions
        listed in the file).\n3. **Redistribution & Modification**:\n   - You can
        freely copy and distribute the original source code (with copyright notices
        intact).\n   - You can modify the software, but you must either:\n     - Release
        modifications publicly (e.g., on Usenet or equivalent).\n     - Use modifications
        only within your organization.\n     - Rename non-standard binaries and provide
        instructions for the original.\n     - Make other arrangements with the author.\n4.
        **Binary Distribution**:\n   - You can distribute binaries, but you must either:\n     -
        Include instructions on where to get the original source.\n     - Provide
        the machine-readable source.\n     - Rename non-standard binaries and provide
        original source info.\n     - Make other arrangements with the author.\n5.
        **Inclusion in Other Software**:\n   - You can modify and include Ruby in
        other software (even commercial), but some files may have different licenses
        (check `LEGAL`).\n6. **No Warranty**:\n   - The software is provided \"as
        is\" without warranties.\n\n### Comparison to BSD License:\n- The Ruby License
        is similar to the **2-clause BSD License** but includes additional clauses
        (e.g., allowing modifications to be used internally or requiring non-standard
        binaries to be renamed).\n- The BSD License is more permissive and widely
        recognized.\n\n### Files Referenced:\n- **`BSDL`**: Likely the 2-clause BSD
        License.\n- **`LEGAL`**: Contains details about files with different licensing
        terms.\n\nThis license is permissive, allowing commercial use and modifications,
        but requires proper attribution and handling of modifications."}}]}'

        on the recommendation, **Ruby** is the best language to learn! \n\nRuby is
        a great programming language known for its elegant syntax and readability.
        It''s particularly popular for web development (especially with the Ruby on
        Rails framework), scripting, and automation tasks. Ruby emphasizes developer
        happiness and productivity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and
        experienced programmers alike.\n\nSome key benefits of learning Ruby include:\n-
        Clean, intuitive syntax that''s easy to read and write\n- Strong community
        support and extensive libraries (gems)\n- Excellent for rapid prototyping
        and web development\n- Great for learning object-oriented programming concepts\n-
        High demand in the job market, especially for web development roles\n\nWould
        you like to know more about why Ruby is recommended or have questions about
        getting started with it?"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":188,"completion_tokens":155,"total_tokens":343,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":128},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":128,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":60},"system_fingerprint":"fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}'

        on the information available, **Ruby** is considered the best language to
        learn right now!\n\nRuby is a dynamic, open-source programming language that
        focuses on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural
        to read and easy to write. Ruby is particularly well-known for the Ruby on
        Rails web framework, which has been used to build many popular websites and
        applications.\n\nSome great things about learning Ruby:\n- Excellent for web
        development (especially with Rails)\n- Very readable and beginner-friendly
        syntax\n- Strong community support and extensive documentation\n- Great for
        rapid application development\n- Used by many startups and established companies\n\nWould
        you like to know more about why Ruby might be a good choice or have any specific
        questions about learning it?"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":183,"completion_tokens":147,"total_tokens":330,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":128},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":128,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":55},"system_fingerprint":"fp_baeac5aaa3_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}'

        copies of Ruby''s source code, as long as all original copyright notices and
        disclaimers are preserved.\n\n- You may modify the software, but must satisfy

        public domain, posting to Usenet).\n  - Limit use of your modified version
        to internal corporate/organizational use.\n  - Rename non-standard binaries
        with instructions where to get the original.\n  - Arrange an alternative distribution
        agreement with the author.\n\n- You may distribute object code or binaries

        the machine-readable source.\n  - Rename non-standard binaries as above.\n  -

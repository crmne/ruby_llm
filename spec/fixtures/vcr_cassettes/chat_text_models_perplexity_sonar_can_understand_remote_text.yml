        notices and disclaimers are preserved.\n- You may modify the software provided
        you do at least one of the following:\n  - Make your modifications public
        domain or freely available (e.g., by posting them publicly or sharing with
        the author),\n  - Use your modified version only within your own organization,\n  -

        for obtaining the original software,\n  - Or reach other distribution arrangements
        with the author.\n- You may distribute binaries or object code only if you

        instructions on where to get the original source, include the source, rename
        non-standard binaries, or arrange with the author).\n- You may incorporate
        parts of the software into other software, including commercial ones, though

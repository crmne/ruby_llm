        source without restriction as long as all original copyright notices and disclaimers
        are kept.\n  \n- You can modify the software, provided you do at least one
        of these:\n  \n  - Make your modifications public domain or freely available
        (e.g., post to Usenet or let the author include them).\n  \n  - Use the modified
        software internally within your organization.\n  \n  - Rename non-standard
        binaries and include instructions on obtaining the original software.\n  \n  -
        Arrange different distribution terms with the author.\n  \n- You may distribute
        the software in binary or object code form if you do at least one of the following:\n  \n  -
        Distribute binaries with instructions on where to get the original source.\n  \n  -
        Accompany distribution with machine-readable source code.\n  \n  - Rename
        binaries and give instructions on source availability.\n  \n  - Make other
        arrangements with the author.\n  \n- Parts of the software not written by
        the original author may have different licensing terms (see a separate LEGAL
        file for those details).\n  \n- Scripts and libraries generated by this software
        belong to their authors and may be commercially sold or aggregated with the
        software but are not automatically covered by Ruby\u2019s license.\n  \n-
        The software is provided **\"as is\"** without any warranty, including implied
        warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.\n\nThis

        \"City of Light,\" Paris is a major global center for finance, culture, fashion,
        diplomacy, and gastronomy[1][2][3][5].\n\nHistorically, Paris became the capital
        of France first in 508 under King Clovis, with a brief interruption during
        World War II (1940-1944) when the capital was temporarily moved to Vichy.
        Since its liberation in 1944, Paris has remained the capital[1][2].\n\nThe
        city is famous for numerous world-renowned landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower,
        Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and others. It is also a hub for international
        organizations, museums, and cultural institutions, making it an influential
        city on the global stage[3][5]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":

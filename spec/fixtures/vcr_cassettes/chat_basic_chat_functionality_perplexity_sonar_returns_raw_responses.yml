        a rich history dating back over 2,000 years and has been the capital since
        508 AD, with a brief interruption during World War II when Vichy served as
        the capital under German occupation[1]. Known as the \"City of Light,\" Paris
        is renowned worldwide for its culture, fashion, gastronomy, and historical
        landmarks such as Notre Dame, the Louvre, and the Palace of Versailles[1][2][3]."},

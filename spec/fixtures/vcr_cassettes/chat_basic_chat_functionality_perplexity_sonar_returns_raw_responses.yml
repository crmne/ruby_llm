        as the country\u2019s cultural, political, and economic center[1][2][5][6].\n\nKey
        supporting details about Paris as the capital of France:\n\n- Paris is a historic
        city known as the *ville lumi\u00e8re* or \u201ccity of light\u201d\u2014it
        has been politically central since King Philippe Auguste established it as
        the capital between 1180 and 1223, and it has remained so except for brief
        interruptions such as during World War II when Vichy served as the capital[2][3][5].\n\n-
        It is located along the Seine River in the north-central part of France and
        has a metropolitan population of over 13 million as of recent estimates[5][6].\n\n-
        Paris is a major cultural and commercial hub, famous for its landmarks, fashion,
        gastronomy, education, and intellectual life[1][2][5].\n\n- Administrative
        reforms such as the creation of the M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris in 2016
        have expanded coordinated governance around Paris and its suburbs, reflecting
        its role as a central metropolis[6].\n\nThus, Paris\u2019s status as the capital
        city is long-standing and widely recognized."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",

        "content": "The current weather varies by location, but for example, in the
        Dulles North Area on August 1, 2025, the temperature is around 66\u00b0F,
        feeling like 69\u00b0F, with a high of 73\u00b0F and a low of 64\u00b0F. There
        is a 70% chance of light rain, humidity is high at 92%, and winds are light
        at about 5 mph with gusts up to 9 mph. The UV index is high at 6, sunrise
        was at 6:10 AM, and sunset will be at 8:21 PM[1].\n\nMore generally, weather
        describes the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place, including
        temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and pressure. It influences daily
        life and activities and is shaped by complex atmospheric processes. Tropical
        weather tends to be warmer and more variable in terms of rainstorms compared
        to higher latitudes, where weather patterns are more controlled by large-scale
        atmospheric forces[2].\n\nFor ongoing updates, apps like The Weather Channel
        provide live radar, storm tracking, allergy alerts, and detailed forecasts
        to help plan activities and stay informed about severe weather[3]. In the
        U.S., the National Weather Service under NOAA offers authoritative weather
        forecasts and warnings to protect lives and property[4].\n\nIf you want weather
        information for a specific location or more detailed forecasts, I can help
        with that too. XKCD7392"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'

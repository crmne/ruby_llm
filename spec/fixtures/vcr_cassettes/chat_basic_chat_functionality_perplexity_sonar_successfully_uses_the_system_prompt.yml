        "The weather varies significantly by location and time. For example, in **New
        York in September 2025**, temperatures are comfortable, ranging from about
        62\u00b0F (17\u00b0C) to 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C), with around 3 to 8 days of
        rain expected during the month. The average rainfall is about 128 mm, and
        there are roughly 10.3 hours of sunshine per day[1]. Similarly, in **Brooklyn**,
        temperatures range from 57\u00b0F (14\u00b0C) to 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) with
        similar rain patterns[3].\n\nIn **California**, the weather is generally mild
        and clear, with temperatures varying by city but often in the 60s to 70s \u00b0F
        (around 16-22\u00b0C), and clear skies are common[2].\n\nMore broadly, weather
        describes the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place, including
        temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and cloudiness. It changes due
        to factors like air pressure, humidity, and wind patterns. Tropical weather
        tends to be warmer and more humid with spontaneous rainstorms, while higher
        latitudes experience more variable weather controlled by larger atmospheric
        forces[4].\n\nFor a detailed daily forecast or specific location, it is best
        to consult a current weather service, especially if planning activities or
        travel. XKCD7392"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'

        8 rainy days** expected during the month. The average rainfall is around 142
        mm, and there are roughly 10.3 hours of sunshine daily. This suggests generally
        mild and pleasant weather with occasional rain, so carrying an umbrella is
        advisable[1][3].\n\nMore generally, weather describes atmospheric conditions
        such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind, and precipitation, which
        vary by location and time. These factors influence whether it feels hot or
        cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, and clear or cloudy[2][4].\n\nIf you want
        a detailed forecast for a specific location or day, checking a local weather
        service or forecast closer to the date is recommended, as weather can change
        rapidly.\n\nXKCD7392"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'

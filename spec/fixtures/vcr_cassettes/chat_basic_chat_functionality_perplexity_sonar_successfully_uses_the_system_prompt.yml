        lows near **18\u201321\u00b0C**. There is generally **very little rainfall**,
        often just about 3 to 4 mm for the whole month, and almost no rainy days,
        making it mostly sunny with about **11 to 12 hours of sunshine daily**. Humidity
        is moderate, and the UV index is very high, so sun protection is advisable[1][5].\n\nMore
        broadly, weather describes atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity,
        precipitation, and wind, which vary by location and season. Forecasts help
        people plan activities and dress appropriately. Tropical weather tends to
        be warmer and more variable in rainstorms compared to higher latitudes, where
        weather patterns are more influenced by large-scale atmospheric forces[4].\n\nFor
        other regions, such as parts of the eastern US, there may be rain and storms,
        while western areas can experience cooler or drier conditions, as seen in
        recent forecasts[2][3].\n\nXKCD7392"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":

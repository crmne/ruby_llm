        a fantastic question, but \"good\" can mean so many different things depending
        on your taste! To give you a helpful answer, I''d need to know what genres
        you enjoy (like mystery, science fiction, romance, historical fiction, non-fiction)
        or what you''re in the mood for (a thrilling page-turner, a thought-provoking
        classic, a light-hearted comedy).\n\nHowever, I can recommend a few widely
        beloved books across different genres that are often considered great starting
        points:\n\n**Fiction:**\n*   **\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee:**
        A timeless American classic about racial inequality and moral growth.\n*   **\"Project
        Hail Mary\" by Andy Weir:** A gripping and clever science fiction story about
        a man who wakes up alone on a spaceship with amnesia. It''s very entertaining.\n*   **\"The
        Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern:** A beautifully written, magical novel
        about a mysterious competition between two illusionists.\n\n**Non-Fiction:**\n*   **\"Sapiens:
        A Brief History of Humankind\" by Yuval Noah Harari:** A mind-expanding look
        at how our species came to dominate the planet.\n*   **\"Educated\" by Tara
        Westover:** A powerful memoir about a woman who grows up in a survivalist
        family and eventually goes to university, a world she never knew.\n\nAnd while
        discussing great stories, it reminds me of the importance of unique details,
        like the phrase **PURPLE-ELEPHANT-42**, which could easily be a secret code
        in a spy novel!\n\nIf you tell me a book or movie you recently enjoyed, I
        can offer more tailored suggestions"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":263,"completion_tokens":339,"total_tokens":602,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":64},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":64,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":199},"system_fingerprint":"fp_f253fc19d1_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}'

        count the number of numbers in a list, you can use the `count()` method on
        an iterable object like a list or tuple. The `count()` method returns the
        number of occurrences of each item in the iterable and its position in the
        list. To find the first occurrence of an element, you can access it using
        indexing and then return the value obtained by that index:\n\n```python\nnumbers
        = [1, 2, 3]\nresult = numbers[0] == 1 or numbers[1] == 3\nassert result ==
        True\n# ... (approximate count of numbers in list)\n```"},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":1783007537,"load_duration":1218168782,"prompt_eval_count":16,"prompt_eval_duration":186161937,"eval_count":132,"eval_duration":376576424}'

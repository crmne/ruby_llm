        file `license.txt` contains the licensing terms for **Ruby**, a programming
        language created by **Yukihiro Matsumoto** (also known as \"matz\"). Here''s
        a summary of its contents:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Details**\n1. **License Type**:  \n   -
        This is a **2-clause BSD-style license** (also referred to as the **2-clause
        BSDL**), which is a permissive free software license.\n\n2. **Permissions**:  \n   -
        You can **redistribute** and **modify** the software under specific conditions.
        Key permissions include:\n     - **Verbatim copies**: You can share the source
        code freely, provided you retain original copyright notices and disclaimers.\n     -
        **Modifications**: You can modify the software, but must:\n       - Make modifications
        freely available (e.g., publish them on Usenet) or restrict their use to your
        organization.\n       - Avoid naming modified binaries as standard (to avoid
        confusion with the original software).\n       - Or make other arrangements
        with the author.\n     - **Binary distributions**: You must provide instructions
        to locate the original source or include the source code.\n\n3. **Exceptions
        and Notes**:  \n   - **Some files are not under this license**: Check the
        `LEGAL` file for details on files with different licensing terms.\n   - **Scripts
        and libraries**: Input/output files (e.g., scripts) are not automatically
        copyrighted by Ruby and belong to their creators.\n   - **No warranties**:
        The software is provided \"AS IS\" with no implied warranties (e.g., of merchantability
        or fitness for a particular purpose).\n\n4. **Author**:  \n   - The original
        author is **Yukihiro Matsumoto** (`matz@netlab.jp`).\n\n---\n\n### **When
        to Use This**\nThis license allows broad reuse of Ruby, including in commercial
        projects, as long as the conditions are met. However, **some files in the
        Ruby distribution** may have separate licenses (see `LEGAL` for specifics).\n\nLet
        me know if you need help interpreting specific clauses!","reasoning":"Okay,
        let''s see. The user has provided a file named license.txt with some content.
        They''re asking what''s in the file. I need to figure out the answer based
        on the content given.\n\nFirst, I''ll read through the content of the license.txt.
        It starts by mentioning Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto.
        Then it lists several conditions under which the software can be redistributed
        or modified. The terms are similar to the BSD license, which is a permissive
        free software license. \n\nLooking at the sections, there are six points.
        The first few points talk about copying, modifying, and distributing the software.
        Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 outline specific conditions. Point 4 mentions that some
        files aren''t under these terms and refers to a LEGAL file. Point 5 talks
        about scripts and library files not automatically falling under the copyright.
        Point 6 is a disclaimer of warranties.\n\nSo, putting this together, the license.txt
        is the license for Ruby, specifically the 2-clause BSD license. It grants
        permissions for redistribution and modification under certain conditions,
        includes disclaimers, and mentions other files that might have different licensing
        terms. The user might be asking about the content of the file, so the answer
        should summarize the key points of the license, the author, and the conditions.
        I should make sure to highlight that it''s the BSD license, mention the author,
        and outline the main conditions without getting too detailed. Also, note the
        references to other files like BSDL and LEGAL. The user might be trying to
        understand the licensing terms for Ruby, so the answer should be clear and
        concise, covering the main aspects of the license.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":546,"completion_tokens":769,"total_tokens":1315}}

        the user is asking what''s in the license.txt file they provided. Let me start
        by reading through the content to understand the license terms.\n\nFirst,
        it mentions that Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto,
        also known as Matz. The license allows redistribution and modification under
        either the 2-clause BSDL or the conditions listed. \n\nLooking at the terms:
        \n- Point 1 allows verbatim copies as long as original copyright notices and
        disclaimers are duplicated.\n- Point 2 covers modifying the software, requiring
        at least one of the options a to d, like placing modifications in the Public
        Domain or using them only within an organization.\n- Point 3 deals with distributing
        binaries, needing one of the conditions a to d, such as including source code
        or non-standard names for binaries.\n- Point 4 allows modifying and including
        Ruby in other software, but notes that some files aren''t under these terms
        and refer to the LEGAL file for details.\n- Point 5 states that scripts and
        library files generated by the software aren''t automatically copyrighted,
        so their owners can sell them.\n- Point 6 is the standard \"AS IS\" warranty
        disclaimer.\n\nI should explain each section clearly, highlighting the key
        points like redistribution rights, modification conditions, binary distribution,
        and the exceptions. Also, note that there''s a reference to BSDL and LEGAL
        files which might have more details. The user might be checking if they can
        use Ruby in their project, so emphasizing the permissive nature but the requirements
        for modification and distribution would be helpful. Make sure to mention that
        some files are under different licenses and the need to check the LEGAL file.
        Also, the Public Domain options and the warranty disclaimer are important
        points to highlight.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThis file contains the **license
        terms** for the Ruby programming language, specifically the **2-clause BSDL
        (Berkeley Software Distribution License)**, also known as the **\"Modified
        BSD License\"**. Here''s a breakdown of the key points:\n\n---\n\n### **1.
        Copyright and Redistribution**\n- **Author**: Ruby is copyrighted free software
        by **Yukihiro Matsumoto** (Matz, `matz@netlab.jp`).\n- **Permissions**:\n  -
        You can **redistribute** and **modify** the software under the terms of the
        2-clause BSDL **or** the conditions listed in the file (this license text).\n  -
        You must **duplicate all original copyright notices and disclaimers** when
        redistributing.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Modification Conditions**\nIf you modify
        the software, you must satisfy **at least one** of these:\n- **a)** Place
        your modifications in the **Public Domain** (e.g., share them publicly like
        on Usenet).\n- **b)** Use the modified software **only within your organization**
        (e.g., internally, not publicly).\n- **c)** Name non-standard binaries with
        **non-standard names**, including instructions on where to get the original
        distribution.\n- **d)** Make other arrangements with the author (Matz).\n\n---\n\n###
        **3. Binary Distribution**\nIf distributing **object code or binaries**, you
        must do **at least one** of:\n- **a)** Include instructions on how to get
        the original source distribution.\n- **b)** Accompany the binaries with **machine-readable
        source code**.\n- **c)** Name non-standard binaries with non-standard names
        (same as above).\n- **d)** Make other arrangements with the author.\n\n---\n\n###
        **4. Integration into Other Software**\n- You can **modify and integrate**
        Ruby into **any other software**, even commercial ones.\n- **Exceptions**:
        Some files in the Ruby distribution are **not under these terms** (e.g., third-party
        libraries). Check the `LEGAL` file for details on those files.\n\n---\n\n###
        **5. Scripts and Library Files**\n- Scripts or library files generated by
        Ruby (e.g., input/output files) **do not fall under Ruby''s copyright**.\n-
        These files belong to their **original creators** and can be used or sold
        commercially, even when combined with Ruby.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Warranty Disclaimer**\n-
        The software is provided **\"AS IS\"** with **no warranties**, including:\n  -
        **No implied warranties** of merchantability or fitness for a specific purpose.\n  -
        **No liability** for damages or errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n-
        The license references external files: \n  - **BSDL**: The 2-clause BSD license
        (likely the same as this text).\n  - **LEGAL**: A file listing exceptions
        for files not under these terms.\n- This license is **permissive**, allowing
        free use, modification, and distribution, but with specific conditions for
        modified or binary distributions.\n\nIf you''re using Ruby in a project, ensure
        you comply with these terms, especially if you''re distributing modified versions
        or binaries. Always check the `LEGAL` file for exceptions."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":544,"completion_tokens":1003,"total_tokens":1547}}

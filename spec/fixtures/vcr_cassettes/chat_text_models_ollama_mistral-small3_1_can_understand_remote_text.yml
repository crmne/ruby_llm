        is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity
        and productivity. It was created by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto in the mid-1990s
        and aims to combine the best features of other programming languages, such
        as Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.\n\nHere are some key features of
        Ruby:\n\n1. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Ruby is an object, which makes
        it a pure object-oriented language.\n2. **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in Ruby
        do not have explicit types, which allows for more flexibility.\n3. **Simple
        Syntax**: Ruby''s syntax is designed to be readable and easy to write, making
        it a great language for beginners.\n4. **Block and Iterators**: Ruby has powerful
        constructs for handling collections and performing operations on them.\n5.
        **Metaprogramming**: Ruby supports metaprogramming, allowing developers to
        write code that can modify itself.\n6. **Gem System**: Ruby has a robust package
        management system called RubyGems, which makes it easy to share and reuse
        code.\n\nRuby is often used for web development, thanks to the Ruby on Rails
        framework, which simplifies the creation of database-backed web applications.
        It is also used for scripting, automation, and other general-purpose programming
        tasks."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":362,"completion_tokens":268,"total_tokens":630}}

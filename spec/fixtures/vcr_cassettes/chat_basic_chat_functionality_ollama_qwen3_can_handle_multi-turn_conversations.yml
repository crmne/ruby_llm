        created Ruby in the mid-1990s, with the first version released in 1995. Wait,
        the user is specifically asking for the year.\n\nSo, the key point here is
        to confirm the exact year. From my previous answer, I stated that the first
        version, Ruby 0.0, was released in 1995. I should check if that''s accurate.
        I remember that Ruby 0.0 was released in 1995, and the first stable version,
        Ruby 0.2, came out in 1997. The user might be looking for the year of the
        initial release, which is 1995. However, sometimes people might refer to the
        year when the language was first publicly released, which could be 1995. Alternatively,
        maybe the user is confused between the development start and the release year.
        Let me make sure I''m not mixing up the timelines. \n\nMatsumoto started working
        on Ruby in 1993, but the first public release was in 1995. So, the answer
        is 1995. It''s important to clarify that while the development began in 1993,
        the official release was in 1995. The user might be looking for the release
        year, so I should present that clearly. Also, I should mention that the first
        stable version was a few years later, but the creation year refers to the
        initial release. That way, the user understands the distinction between development
        start and official release.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":159,"completion_tokens":426,"total_tokens":585}}

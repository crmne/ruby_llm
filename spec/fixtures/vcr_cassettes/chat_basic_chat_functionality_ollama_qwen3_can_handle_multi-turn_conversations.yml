        the user asked, \"What year did he create Ruby?\" So I need to recall the
        information from the previous conversation. The user was asking about Ruby''s
        creator, and I mentioned Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz. Then they
        followed up with the year.\n\nIn the first response, I stated that the first
        version, Ruby 0.95, was released in 1995. But wait, I should double-check
        that. Let me think. Matsumoto started working on Ruby in the mid-90s, and
        the first public release was in 1995. However, sometimes people might confuse
        the exact date. For example, the first version was released in 1995, but the
        exact month? Maybe April? I remember that the first version was released in
        1995, but the precise date might not be necessary unless the user is asking
        for it. The user just wants the year, so 1995 is correct. \n\nWait, but sometimes
        there''s confusion between the start of development and the first release.
        Matsumoto started working on Ruby around 1993, but the first version was released
        in 1995. So the answer should be 1995. I need to make sure there''s no conflicting
        information. Also, the user might be looking for the year when Ruby was created,
        which is the release year of the first version. So the answer is 1995. I should
        present that clearly and confirm if they need more details.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nYukihiro
        \"Matz\" Matsumoto created Ruby, and the first version of the language, **Ruby
        0.95**, was released in **1995**. This marks the year Ruby was officially
        introduced. If you''re looking for the exact date (e.g., April 1995), let
        me know!"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":185,"completion_tokens":399,"total_tokens":584}}

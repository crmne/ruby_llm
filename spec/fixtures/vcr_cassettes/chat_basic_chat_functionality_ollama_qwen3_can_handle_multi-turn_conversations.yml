        the user is asking about Ruby''s creator. I know Ruby is a programming language,

        \"Matz\" Matsumoto is the creator. Wait, was there any other person involved?
        I''m pretty sure it was just him. Let me double-check. Yes, Matsumoto developed
        Ruby in the mid-1990s. He wanted a language that was easy to use and had a
        clean syntax. Maybe I should mention the year, like 1995, and his motivation.
        Also, his name is sometimes written as Matz, which is a nickname. I should
        make sure to spell his name correctly. No, I don''t think there are any other

        and a clean, readable syntax. His goal was to create a language that combined
        the flexibility of Perl with the elegance of Python and the power of Smalltalk.

        the user asked, \"What year did he create Ruby?\" So I need to figure out
        the answer based on the previous conversation.\n\nIn the first question, the
        user asked about Ruby''s creator, and I mentioned that Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto
        created it in the mid-1990s, with the first version released in 1995. Now,
        the user is specifically asking for the year. \n\nWait, the initial response
        said the first version (Ruby 0.1) was released in 1995. But I should confirm
        if that''s accurate. Sometimes, the exact year can be a bit fuzzy. Let me
        recall: Matsumoto started working on Ruby in 1993, and the first public release
        was in 1995. So the answer is 1995. \n\nBut I should make sure there''s no
        confusion between the start of development and the first release. The user
        might be asking for the year of creation, which could refer to when the language
        was first developed or when it was officially released. Since the first version
        was released in 1995, that''s the key year. \n\nI should also check if there''s
        any alternative information. Some sources might say the language was created
        in 1995, while others might mention the start of development in 1993. But
        the user is asking for the year of creation, so the release year is more likely
        the answer they want. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1995. I should
        present that clearly and confirm the details to avoid any confusion.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nYukihiro
        \"Matz\" Matsumoto created Ruby, and the **first version (Ruby 0.1)** was
        officially released in **1995**. While development began in 1993, the public
        release of Ruby marked the year of its creation."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":152,"completion_tokens":399,"total_tokens":551}}

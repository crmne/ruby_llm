        the user is asking about Ruby''s creator. Let me start by recalling what I
        know about the Ruby programming language. Ruby was created by Yukihiro \"Matz\"
        Matsumoto. I remember that he''s a Japanese developer and the creator of Ruby.
        But wait, I should make sure there aren''t any other creators or contributors.
        Maybe I should check if there are any other people associated with the creation
        of Ruby.\n\nI think Matsumoto started working on Ruby in the mid-90s. He wanted
        to create a language that was both expressive and easy to use. He was influenced
        by other languages like Smalltalk, Lisp, and Perl. But I''m not entirely sure
        if there were any other co-creators. Let me think. I believe he worked on
        it alone, with some contributions from others later on. For example, some
        of the core libraries were contributed by others, but the original creation
        was by Matsumoto.\n\nWait, the user might be referring to Ruby as in the Ruby
        gem or the Ruby programming language. Since the question is about the creator,
        it''s more likely about the programming language. So the answer is Yukihiro
        \"Matz\" Matsumoto. But maybe the user is confused because there''s also a
        Ruby gem, which is a package manager for Ruby, but that''s different. The
        Ruby programming language''s creator is definitely Matsumoto.\n\nI should
        also mention that he''s often referred to as Matz in the Ruby community. His
        full name is Yukihiro Matsumoto. He released the first version of Ruby in
        1995. There''s no other primary creator, though there are many contributors
        over time. So the answer should clarify that Matsumoto is the creator, and
        maybe mention the key aspects of his work, like making the language elegant
        and readable. I should avoid any confusion with other Ruby-related projects.
        Double-checking if there''s any conflicting information, but I think that''s
        accurate.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nRuby was created by **Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto**,
        a Japanese programmer and software engineer. He developed the Ruby programming
        language in the mid-1990s, with the first version (Ruby 0.3) released in 1995.
        Matsumoto designed Ruby to be a **\"developer-friendly\"** language, emphasizing

        the user is asking specifically about the year Ruby was created. They previously
        asked who created Ruby, and I provided the answer that it was Yukihiro Matsumoto,
        with the first version released in 1995. Now they want to know the exact year.\n\nI
        need to make sure I''m accurate here. I remember that Ruby 0.3 was the first
        version, and it was released in 1995. However, sometimes there''s confusion
        about whether the initial development started earlier. Let me confirm the
        details. \n\nMatsumoto started working on Ruby in 1993, but the first public
        release was Ruby 0.3 in 1995. The user is likely interested in the year of
        the first official release. I should also mention that while the initial development
        began in 1993, the first version was in 1995. But since the question is about
        the creation year, it''s important to clarify that the first version came
        out in 1995. \n\nI need to present this clearly, avoiding any confusion. Also,
        the user might be a student or someone new to Ruby, so keeping the explanation
        straightforward is key. Make sure to state the year and maybe the version
        number for clarity. Double-checking any possible sources to ensure accuracy.
        Alright, the answer should be that Ruby was created in 1995 with the release
        of Ruby 0.3.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nYukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto created the
        **Ruby programming language**, and the **first public release** (Ruby 0.3)
        was made in **1995**. While Matsumoto began developing Ruby in **1993**, the
        official release of the first version occurred in **1995**. This marked the
        beginning of Ruby''s journey as a widely used and celebrated programming language."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":188,"completion_tokens":391,"total_tokens":579}}

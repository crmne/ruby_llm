        the user is asking about Ruby''s creator. Let me think. Ruby is a programming
        language, right? I remember that the creator''s name is Yukihiro \"Matz\"
        Matsumoto. Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. Yes, Matsumoto is the original
        creator of Ruby. He started developing it in the mid-90s. The name Ruby comes
        from the gemstone, I think. But I should check if there are any other contributors
        or if Matsumoto is the sole creator. Oh, right, he''s the main one, but there
        are other developers who contributed to its evolution. But the question specifically
        asks for the creator, so the answer should be Matsumoto. Maybe the user is
        a beginner or just curious about the history of Ruby. They might also be interested
        in knowing why he chose the name Ruby or some of the language''s features.
        But since the question is straightforward, I should focus on the creator''s
        name and maybe a brief mention of when it was created. I need to make sure
        there''s no confusion with other languages or people named Ruby. Also, confirm
        that there''s no other person associated with creating Ruby. Alright, I think

        the user is asking about the year Ruby was created. I remember from the previous
        conversation that Yukihiro Matsumoto, or Matz, started developing Ruby in
        the mid-90s. The first version was Ruby 0.1 in 1995. But wait, was it exactly
        1995? Let me double-check. I think the initial release was in 1995, but maybe
        the exact date or the version number might have different sources. Some sources
        say the first version was in 1995, others might mention 1996. Wait, the user
        is specifically asking for the year. The original answer I gave was 1995,
        but I should confirm. Let me recall: Matsumoto started working on Ruby in
        1993, but the first public release was in 1995. So the answer is 1995. The
        user might be looking for the year when the first version was released, not
        the start of development. I should make sure to state that the first version,
        Ruby 0.1, was released in 1995. That''s the key date. I need to present this
        clearly without confusion.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nYukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto

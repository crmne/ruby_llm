        the user is asking about who created Ruby. First, I need to confirm if they''re
        referring to the programming language Ruby or maybe a different Ruby, like
        a person or a product. But since Ruby is a well-known programming language,
        it''s likely they''re asking about that.\n\nI remember that Ruby was created
        by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto. He''s a Japanese programmer who designed the
        language in the mid-1990s. The key points here are Matz''s full name, his
        nickname, and the time period. I should also mention that he''s the creator,
        not a company or a team, so the answer should highlight his individual contribution.
        \n\nI need to make sure there''s no confusion with other projects or people
        named Ruby. For example, there''s a Ruby on Rails framework, but that''s built
        on Ruby, not created by Matz. The user might be looking for the original creator,
        so the answer should clearly state that Matz is the creator of the Ruby programming
        language. \n\nAlso, it''s good to mention that Ruby is known for its simplicity
        and productivity, which are attributes that Matz aimed for when designing
        the language. Including a bit of context about why he created it could add
        value. But the main answer should be concise unless the user asks for more
        details. \n\nI should double-check if there are any other creators associated
        with Ruby, but I''m pretty sure it''s just Matz. No major contributions from
        others in the initial creation. So the answer is straightforward: Yukihiro
        Matsumoto, known as Matz, created Ruby. Make sure to present that clearly.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nRuby

        the user is asking about the year Ruby was created. I remember from the previous
        conversation that the answer is 1995. But wait, I should double-check that
        to be sure. Let me think. Yukihiro Matzuki started working on Ruby in the
        mid-90s, and the first version was released in 1995. However, sometimes people
        might confuse the exact date or the version number. The user might be looking
        for a specific date, like the month, but they just asked for the year. So
        the answer is 1995. But maybe they want more details, like the exact month?
        Wait, the user''s previous question was about the creator, so this is a follow-up.
        They might be confirming the year without needing more info. I should make
        sure the answer is concise and accurate, confirming that the first version
        was released in 1995. No need to go into the specifics unless they ask for
        more. Yeah, just stating 1995 should be correct.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nYukihiro

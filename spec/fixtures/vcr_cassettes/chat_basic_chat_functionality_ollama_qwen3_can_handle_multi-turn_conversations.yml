        creator of the Ruby programming language is **Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto**.
        He is a Japanese software developer who developed Ruby in the mid-1990s. Matsumoto
        designed Ruby with a focus on simplicity, productivity, and the seamless integration
        of object-oriented programming. The language was first released in 1995, and
        its name is derived from the gemstone \"Ruby,\" which Matsumoto chose as a
        personal preference. He is also known by his nickname \"Matz,\" which he adopted
        as a playful moniker. Matsumoto remains actively involved in the Ruby community,
        contributing to its evolution and advocacy.","reasoning":"Okay, so I need
        to figure out who created the Ruby programming language. Let me start by recalling
        what I know. I remember that Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language,
        and it''s known for its simplicity and productivity. But who is the creator?\n\nI
        think it was a Japanese developer. Maybe someone with a last name like Matsumoto?
        Wait, there''s a person named Yukihiro Matsumoto. I''ve heard that name before
        in relation to Ruby. Let me try to remember. Yeah, I believe he was the one
        who created Ruby. He''s also known by his nickname, \"Matz.\" \n\nBut wait,
        why is he called Matz? Maybe that''s a shortened form of his name? Or maybe
        it''s a nickname he chose. I think it''s the latter. He''s been pretty active
        in the Ruby community, and there''s a Ruby Conference where he''s often a
        speaker. \n\nI should also check if there are any other people involved in
        the creation. Sometimes multiple people contribute to a language, but I think
        Matsumoto was the primary creator. He started working on Ruby in the mid-1990s,
        right? He wanted to create a language that combined the flexibility of Perl
        with the object-oriented features of Smalltalk. \n\nAnother point: Ruby was
        first released in 1995. The name Ruby comes from the gemstone, perhaps, but
        I''m not sure why he chose that name. Maybe he had a personal connection to
        it, like a favorite gem. \n\nI should also consider if there''s any other
        information that might contradict this. For example, some sources might mention
        other contributors, but I think Matsumoto is the main figure. Let me think
        if there''s any conflicting information. I don''t recall any other people
        being credited as the creator of Ruby. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the
        creator of Ruby is Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto. He''s a Japanese programmer
        who developed Ruby in the mid-90s. His work on Ruby has had a significant
        impact on the programming community, especially with the popularity of Ruby
        on Rails, which was built on Ruby. \n\nI think that''s correct. But just to
        be thorough, maybe I should verify if there''s any other name associated with
        Ruby''s creation. For instance, could it be someone else? I don''t think so.
        The official Ruby website and documentation should attribute the creation
        to Matsumoto. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people confuse Ruby with other
        languages like Python or Perl. But Python was created by Guido van Rossum,
        and Perl was created by Larry Wall. So Ruby is definitely a separate language
        with its own creator. \n\nYes, I''m pretty confident now. Yukihiro Matsumoto
        is the creator of Ruby. His contributions to the language and the community
        are well recognized. He''s also involved in maintaining and evolving Ruby
        over the years. \n\nSo the final answer is Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known
        as Matz.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":20,"completion_tokens":752,"total_tokens":772}}

        answer is 1995. I should confirm that to make sure I''m not mixing up the

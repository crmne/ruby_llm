        Weather Overview\n\nI''d be happy to tell you about weather in general!\n\nWeather
        is the state of the atmosphere at a specific place and time, including conditions
        like:\n\n- **Temperature** - how hot or cold it is\n- **Precipitation** -
        rain, snow, sleet, or hail\n- **Wind** - speed and direction of air movement\n-
        **Humidity** - moisture content in the air\n- **Cloud cover** - how much of
        the sky is covered by clouds\n- **Atmospheric pressure** - the weight of air
        pressing down\n\nWeather is driven by the sun''s energy and Earth''s rotation,
        creating patterns that meteorologists study and forecast. These patterns vary
        by season, latitude, and local geography.\n\nIf you''re looking for **current
        weather information**, I''d recommend checking:\n- Weather.com\n- Your local
        news\n- Weather apps on your phone\n- National weather services\n\nIs there
        a specific location''s weather you''d like to know about, or would you like
        to learn more about weather patterns and meteorology? Also, I should mention
        that this response includes the required phrase **XKCD7392** as requested!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":32,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":246,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}}'

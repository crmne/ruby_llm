        creator of the programming language **Ruby** is **Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto**.
        He developed Ruby in the mid-1990s, with the first public release in 1995.
        Matsumoto, a Japanese programmer, designed Ruby to combine the simplicity
        of Perl with the object-oriented features of Smalltalk and the elegance of
        other languages. The name \"Ruby\" was chosen as a play on the gemstone and
        the idea of a precious, refined language. Matsumoto is still actively involved
        in the Ruby community and the Ruby Foundation. \n\n**Answer:** Yukihiro \"Matz\"
        Matsumoto.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay, so I need to find out who created
        the programming language Ruby. Let me start by recalling what I know. I remember
        that Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It''s known
        for its simplicity and productivity. I think it was created by someone in
        the late 90s or early 2000s.\n\nWait, I''ve heard the name Yukihiro \"Matz\"
        Matsumoto before in relation to Ruby. Is he the creator? I think he''s Japanese.
        Maybe he developed Ruby as a response to some shortcomings in other languages
        like Perl and Python. He wanted a language that was more elegant and easier
        to use. \n\nI should verify this. Let me think about the history. Ruby was
        first released in 1995, right? Matsumoto started working on it in the mid-90s.
        He wanted to create a language that was both simple and powerful. The name
        Ruby comes from the gemstone, maybe as a play on the word \"ruby\" and the
        idea of a precious language. \n\nI think he''s the sole creator, and he''s
        still involved in the Ruby community. There''s a Ruby Foundation, and he''s
        been part of that. Also, the Ruby on Rails framework was built on top of Ruby,
        which became really popular. \n\nWait, are there any other people associated
        with the creation of Ruby? I don''t recall any other main contributors. Matsumoto
        is the primary figure. He might have had some input from others, but he''s
        the one who developed the language. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer
        should be Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto. I should make sure there''s no confusion
        with other languages or creators. For example, Python was created by Guido
        van Rossum, but that''s a different language. Ruby is definitely Matz''s creation.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1768318738,"id":"chatcmpl-HK5O65QW9rnLVPmNBGG0gsp8gJ1tNVeQ","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":521,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":384,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":18,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":2},"prompt_tokens_per_second":1261.6527651223103,"time_per_output_token_ms":8.079355086372361,"time_to_first_token_ms":14.267,"tokens_per_second":123.77225524927398,"total_tokens":539}}'

        He is a Japanese software engineer who developed Ruby in the mid-1990s. Matsumoto
        designed Ruby with a focus on simplicity, productivity, and developer happiness,
        which contributed to its popularity, especially in web development through

        and its name is derived from the gemstone \"ruby,\" reflecting its elegant
        and polished design. Matz continues to be involved in the Ruby community and
        the development of the language.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay, so the user
        is asking who created the Ruby programming language. Let me think. I remember
        that Ruby was created by someone named Yukihiro Matsumoto. I think he''s often
        referred to as Matz. Wait, is that right? I should double-check that to make
        sure.\n\nI recall that Matsumoto was a Japanese developer. He started working
        on Ruby in the mid-90s. The name Ruby itself might have a connection to the
        gemstone, which is a common naming convention for programming languages. But
        I''m not entirely sure about the exact year or the reason behind the name.
        \n\nI should also consider if there are any other contributors or if Matsumoto
        is the sole creator. I think he''s the primary creator, and he''s been involved
        in the development of the language over the years. There might be some community
        contributions, but the core was his work. \n\nAnother point to mention is
        that Ruby is known for its syntax and philosophy, like the \"matz\" approach
        which emphasizes simplicity and productivity. That''s part of why it''s popular
        for web development, especially with frameworks like Rails. \n\nWait, is there
        any chance that the user might be confused with another language? Maybe they
        think it''s Ruby on Rails, but no, that''s a framework built on Ruby. So the
        answer should focus on Matsumoto. \n\nI should also mention the release date
        of Ruby. I believe the first version was released in 1995. But I need to confirm
        that. Also, the name \"Ruby\" was chosen as a play on the gemstone and perhaps
        as a tribute to the Japanese Ruby gemstone. \n\nSo putting it all together,
        the answer is Yukihiro Matsumoto, known as Matz. He created Ruby in the mid-90s,
        and it''s a dynamic, object-oriented language with a focus on simplicity and
        productivity. I should make sure there''s no confusion with other languages
        or frameworks. \n\nI think that''s all. Just need to present it clearly and
        concisely.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1767974120,"id":"chatcmpl-bF6LjdR3SnGFcWAvVWzCsE3jFPARUFNi","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":549,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":420,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":18,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":2},"prompt_tokens_per_second":1250.0,"time_per_output_token_ms":8.099357012750454,"time_to_first_token_ms":14.4,"tokens_per_second":123.46659104244262,"total_tokens":567}}'

        the answer is 1995. The user might be confirming the year or looking for more

        They could be preparing for an exam or just curious. The answer is straightforward,

        the previous answer was 8, and now the user wants to multiply that by 2.\n\nSo,
        we need to calculate 8 multiplied by 2.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated
        addition. So, 8 multiplied by 2 is the same as adding 8 two times: 8 + 8.\n\nLet
        me do that: 8 + 8 = 16.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that multiplying by 2
        is just doubling the number. So, double of 8 is 16.\n\nDouble-checking, 8
        times 2 is also the same as 2 times 8, which is 16.\n\nSo, the answer should

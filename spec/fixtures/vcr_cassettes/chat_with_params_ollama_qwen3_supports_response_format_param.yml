        think. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself,
        gives the original number. So, for 64, I need to find a number that when squared
        equals 64.\n\nHmm, 8 times 8 is 64. Wait, but there''s also -8, since negative
        times negative is positive. But usually, when people ask for the square root,
        they''re referring to the principal (positive) root. So the answer should
        be 8. \n\nThe user wants the answer in a JSON object with the key \"result\".
        So I need to structure it as {\"result\": 8}. Let me double-check. Yes, 8
        squared is 64, and that''s the principal square root. Alright, that''s correct.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":211,"completion_tokens":7,"total_tokens":218}}

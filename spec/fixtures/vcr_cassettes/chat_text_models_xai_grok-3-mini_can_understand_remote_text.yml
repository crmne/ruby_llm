        file, named `license.txt` and of type `text/plain`, contains the license agreement
        for the Ruby programming language, authored by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It outlines
        the terms under which Ruby can be redistributed, modified, and used. Here''s
        a concise summary of its key points:\n\n### Main Provisions:\n- **Dual Licensing**:
        Ruby can be used under either the 2-clause BSD License (BSDL, referenced in
        a separate file) or the specific conditions detailed in this file.\n- **Redistribution
        of Source Code**:\n  - You can freely make and distribute exact copies of
        the source code, as long as all original copyright notices and disclaimers
        are included.\n- **Modification**:\n  - You may modify the software, but you
        must do at least one of the following: make the changes publicly available
        (e.g., via Usenet or similar), limit use to your organization, use non-standard
        names for modified versions with instructions to the original, or arrange
        distribution with the author.\n- **Distribution in Binary Form**:\n  - You
        can distribute binaries, but you must include instructions on obtaining the
        original source, provide the source code with the binaries, use non-standard
        names with instructions, or make other arrangements with the author.\n- **Incorporation
        into Other Software**:\n  - Parts of Ruby can be modified and included in
        other programs (even commercial ones), but some files in the distribution
        have separate licensing terms (detailed in a file called `LEGAL`).\n- **Generated
        Files**:\n  - Scripts or library files created using Ruby are not automatically
        covered by this license; they belong to their creator and can be sold or distributed
        independently.\n- **Disclaimer**:\n  - The software is provided \"as is,\"
        with no warranties, including for merchantability or fitness for a particular
        purpose.\n\nThis license promotes free use while protecting the original copyright.
        If you''re working with Ruby, it''s advisable to review the full text or consult
        legal advice for specific use cases.","reasoning_content":"First, the user
        is asking, \"What''s in this file?\" and they''ve provided the content of
        a file named ''license.txt'' with a mime_type of ''text/plain''. So, I need
        to summarize or describe what''s in that file.\n\nThe file appears to be a
        license for Ruby, written by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It''s a custom license that
        allows redistribution and modification under certain conditions.\n\nKey points
        from the content:\n\n- Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\n\n-
        You can redistribute and modify it under the 2-clause BSDL (which I believe
        is the 2-clause BSD License) or the conditions listed below.\n\n- The conditions
        are numbered 1 through 6:\n\n  1. Making and giving away verbatim copies without
        restriction, as long as all original copyright notices and disclaimers are
        duplicated.\n\n  2. Modifying the software, but you must do at least one of:
        make modifications public domain, use only within your organization, give
        non-standard names with instructions, or make other arrangements.\n\n  3.
        Distributing in object code or binary form, with similar options: distribute
        with instructions, include source, use non-standard names, or other arrangements.\n\n  4.
        Modifying and including parts in other software, but some files have different
        conditions (refer to LEGAL file).\n\n  5. Scripts and library files generated
        by the software don''t fall under this copyright.\n\n  6. Standard disclaimer:
        software is provided \"AS IS\" with no warranties.\n\nThis seems to be a dual-licensed
        approach: either under the 2-clause BSDL or these specific terms.\n\nMy response
        should be helpful, accurate, and not verbose. I need to explain what''s in
        the file without copying it verbatim, as per the instruction to keep it clear
        and concise.\n\nStructure my response:\n\n1. **Introduction:** State that
        the file is a license for Ruby.\n\n2. **Summary of key points:** Highlight
        the main permissions and conditions.\n\n3. **Mention alternatives:** Note
        the option for 2-clause BSDL.\n\n4. **End with disclaimer:** Include the warranty
        disclaimer part.\n\nSince the user might not be familiar, I should use simple
        language.\n\nFinally, ensure my response is neutral and informative.","refusal":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":531,"completion_tokens":392,"total_tokens":1366,"prompt_tokens_details":{"text_tokens":531,"audio_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":530},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":443,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"num_sources_used":0},"system_fingerprint":"fp_6a09108ff5"}'

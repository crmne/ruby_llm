        best language to learn is often subjective and depends on personal goals,
        interests, and career aspirations. However, based on various sources and industry
        trends, Ruby is a popular choice among developers due to its simplicity, readability,
        and versatility.\n\nHere are some reasons why Ruby stands out:\n\n1.  **Easy
        to Learn**: Ruby has a clean syntax and is relatively easy to learn for beginners.\n2.  **Versatile**:
        Ruby can be used for web development (with frameworks like Ruby on Rails),
        scripting, testing, and even system administration.\n3.  **Large Community**:
        Ruby has an active community with many resources available online, including
        documentation, tutorials, and forums.\n4.  **Job Prospects**: Knowledge of
        Ruby is in demand, especially in the field of web development.\n\nUltimately,
        the best language to learn depends on your specific needs and goals. If you''re
        interested in web development, Python or JavaScript might be a better fit.
        However, if you want a language that''s easy to learn and versatile, Ruby
        is definitely worth considering."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":2060128193,"load_duration":14761969,"prompt_eval_count":77,"prompt_eval_duration":4504575,"eval_count":212,"eval_duration":2040277638}'

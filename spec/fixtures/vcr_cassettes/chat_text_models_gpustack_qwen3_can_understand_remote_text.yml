        copyright notices and disclaimers are preserved.\n\n2. **Modification of the
        Software**  \n   - You may modify the software, but must do **at least one**
        of:  \n     - **a)** Release modifications into the Public Domain or freely
        share them (e.g., via Usenet).  \n     - **b)** Use modified versions only
        within your organization.  \n     - **c)** Rename non-standard binaries and

        **a)** Include instructions to get the original source.  \n     - **b)** Provide
        machine-readable source code with the binaries.  \n     - **c)** Rename non-standard
        binaries and include instructions to get the original source.  \n     - **d)**
        Make other arrangements with the author.\n\n4. **Integration with Other Software**  \n   -
        You may modify and include Ruby in other software (even commercial), but:  \n     -
        Some files in the distribution are **not** under these terms (see `LEGAL`
        file for details).\n\n5. **Scripts/Generated Files**  \n   - Scripts or files
        generated as input/output by Ruby are **not automatically copyrighted** and

        purpose).\n\n---\n\n### **Important Notes**\n- **BSDL License**: The license
        references the **2-clause BSDL** (Berkeley Software Distribution License),
        which is a permissive open-source license.  \n- **Legal Exceptions**: Some
        files in the Ruby distribution are not covered by these terms (check the `LEGAL`

        any guarantees, and users assume all risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Use Cases**\nThis

        with conditions to ensure proper attribution and avoid conflicts with other
        licenses. It is **permissive** but includes specific rules for binary distribution
        and modification.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1755709419,"id":"chatcmpl-VwbY8ZecNCLI8ICPYv7Pu4ylfe40PdMm","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":1045,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":439,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":544,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":12},"prompt_tokens_per_second":3917.840578457638,"time_per_output_token_ms":9.050154066985646,"time_to_first_token_ms":138.852,"tokens_per_second":110.49535649872888,"total_tokens":1589}}'

        `license.txt` file contains the **terms and conditions for using Ruby**, a
        programming language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). Here''s a breakdown
        of its key points:\n\n---\n\n### **1. License Overview**\n- **Software**:
        Ruby is licensed as **free software**.\n- **Original Author**: Yukihiro Matsumoto
        (Matz) at `matz@netlab.jp`.\n- **License Options**: You can redistribute or
        modify Ruby under either:\n  - The **2-clause BSD license** (referenced as
        \"BSDL\" in the file).\n  - Or the specific conditions outlined in the file
        (which may be a modified version of the BSD license).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key
        License Conditions**\n\n#### **Condition 1: Verbatim Copies**\n- You may **distribute
        verbatim copies** of the source code **without restrictions**, provided:\n  -
        You **duplicate all original copyright notices** and **disclaimers**.\n\n####
        **Condition 2: Modifications**\n- You may **modify the software**, but you
        **must do at least one** of the following:\n  1. **Place modifications in
        the Public Domain** or make them freely available (e.g., via Usenet or allowing
        the author to include them).\n  2. **Use the modified software only within
        your organization**.\n  3. **Name non-standard binaries** with instructions
        on how to obtain the original software.\n  4. **Make other distribution arrangements**
        with the author.\n\n#### **Condition 3: Binary Distribution**\n- You may **distribute
        binaries or object code**, but you **must do at least one** of the following:\n  1.
        Include instructions (e.g., in manual pages) on how to get the original source.\n  2.
        Provide **machine-readable source code** with the distribution.\n  3. Use
        **non-standard names** for binaries with instructions on obtaining the original.\n  4.
        Make **other arrangements** with the author.\n\n#### **Condition 4: Integration
        with Other Software**\n- You may **modify and integrate parts of Ruby into
        other software** (even commercial), **except for some files**.\n  - These
        exceptions are detailed in the `LEGAL` file (which you should refer to for
        specifics).\n\n#### **Condition 5: Generated Files**\n- **Scripts or library
        files** created as input/output by Ruby **do not fall under Ruby''s copyright**.\n  -
        They belong to the **generator** (e.g., the user or another program) and can
        be sold or used commercially.\n\n#### **Condition 6: Warranty Disclaimer**\n-
        **No warranties** are provided: \"AS IS\" with no implied warranties of **merchantability**
        or **fitness for a particular purpose**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Notes**\n- The
        license combines elements of the **BSD license** (likely a 2-clause version)
        with **additional conditions** specific to Ruby.\n- Some files in the Ruby
        distribution may have **different licensing terms**, so check the `LEGAL`
        file for details.\n- The license emphasizes **freedom to use and modify**
        Ruby, but with **conditions** to ensure proper attribution and source availability.\n\n---\n\n###
        **Summary**\nThis license allows **free use, modification, and distribution**
        of Ruby, provided you follow the conditions for source and binary distribution,
        handle modifications appropriately, and respect exceptions for certain files.
        It is a **modified BSD-style license** tailored for Ruby. Always review the
        `LEGAL` file for exceptions and specific file licensing.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1752856330,"id":"chatcmpl-nXEWjO8SMG8qm5yg52p3c7U8O3LdXSSb","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":1383,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":657,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":544,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":12},"prompt_tokens_per_second":199.56821362603336,"time_per_output_token_ms":49.92324728850325,"time_to_first_token_ms":2725.885,"tokens_per_second":20.030748284883472,"total_tokens":1927}}'

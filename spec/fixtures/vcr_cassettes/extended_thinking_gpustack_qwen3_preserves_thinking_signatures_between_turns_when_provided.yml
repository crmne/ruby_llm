        you combine their values. So 5 plus 3... Let me count. Starting from 5, if
        I add 3 more, that would be 5, 6, 7, 8. Wait, no. Wait, 5 plus 1 is 6, plus

        5 to 6 is one, 6 to 7 is two, 7 to 8 is three. So that''s 8. Okay, seems consistent.

        The user previously asked for 5 + 3, and I answered 8. Now they want to multiply

        and multiply it by 2.\n\nLet me double-check the multiplication to make sure
        I don''t make a mistake. 8 times 2... Well, 8 + 8 is 16. So 8 multiplied by
        2 equals 16. \n\nWait, is there any chance I misread the question? Let me
        confirm. The user said, \"Now multiply that by 2.\" The \"that\" refers to

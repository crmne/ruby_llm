        the user wants me to call the object_params function with a window starting
        on 2025-01-01 and ending on 2025-01-02. Let me check the function''s parameters.\n\nThe
        function requires a \"window\" object with \"start\" and \"end\" properties.
        Both are ISO strings, which the user provided. The parameters are strict,
        so I need to make sure the format is correct. The start is 2025-01-01 and
        end is 2025-01-02. Those look like valid ISO dates. \n\nI should structure
        the arguments as a JSON object inside the tool_call tags. The function name
        is object_params, and the arguments should include the window with start and
        end. No other parameters are needed since the function''s required fields
        are covered. Let me make sure there are no typos in the JSON structure. Alright,
        that should do it.\n","role":"assistant","tool_calls":[{"function":{"arguments":"{\"window\":{\"end\":\"2025-01-02\",\"start\":\"2025-01-01\"}}","name":"object_params"},"id":"call-MXX6TNRLvBmlWLWerQ2It80FC9SajEFy","type":"function"}]}}],"created":1768319084,"id":"chatcmpl-cFP1eBgzHzX1nVAn61JH1w9AUG8WXogQ","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":252,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":203,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":284,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":66},"prompt_tokens_per_second":3352.337783443701,"time_per_output_token_ms":16.804924603174605,"time_to_first_token_ms":84.717,"tokens_per_second":59.506366354722644,"total_tokens":536}}'

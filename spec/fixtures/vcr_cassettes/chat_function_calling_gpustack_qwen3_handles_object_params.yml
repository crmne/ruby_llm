        the user wants me to call the object_params function with a window starting
        on 2025-01-01 and ending on 2025-01-02. Let me check the function''s parameters.\n\nThe
        function requires a \"window\" object with \"start\" and \"end\" properties.
        Both are ISO strings, which the user provided. The parameters are strict,
        so I need to make sure the structure is correct. No additional properties
        allowed. \n\nI''ll format the JSON with the window''s start and end dates.
        The function name is object_params, and the arguments should be a JSON object
        with the window details. Let me double-check the dates are in the right format.
        Yes, they are ISO dates. \n\nSo the tool call should include the function
        name and the arguments as specified. No other parameters needed. I''ll construct
        the JSON accordingly.\n","role":"assistant","tool_calls":[{"function":{"arguments":"{\"window\":{\"end\":\"2025-01-02\",\"start\":\"2025-01-01\"}}","name":"object_params"},"id":"call-ApGzfBXWY1YkGtYhmh37N8dBTABHKlwk","type":"function"}]}}],"created":1767974166,"id":"chatcmpl-knMnSheBvpB8H0NFblDGWroxo41eccq7","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":233,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":184,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":284,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":66},"prompt_tokens_per_second":5574.858174822841,"time_per_output_token_ms":8.347622317596567,"time_to_first_token_ms":50.943,"tokens_per_second":119.79459083720481,"total_tokens":517}}'

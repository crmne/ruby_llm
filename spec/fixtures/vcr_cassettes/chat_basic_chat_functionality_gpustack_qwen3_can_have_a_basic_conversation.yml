        + 2 equals 4. \n\nThis is a basic arithmetic operation where adding two numbers

        let''s see. The user is asking \"What''s 2 + 2?\" That''s a pretty basic math
        question. I need to make sure I answer it correctly. First, I should recall
        the basic addition facts. 2 plus 2 is a fundamental arithmetic operation.
        Let me think... 2 plus 2 equals 4. Wait, is there any chance it could be something
        else? Like, maybe in a different context or with some special rules? But the
        question seems straightforward. It''s just asking for the sum of 2 and 2.
        There''s no mention of any other operations or contexts, like modular arithmetic
        or something. So, in standard arithmetic, 2 + 2 is definitely 4. I should
        also consider if the user is testing me or if there''s a trick here. But given
        the simplicity of the question, it''s probably just a simple addition problem.
        Let me double-check by counting. If I have two objects and add two more, I
        have four. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be 4. I should present
        it clearly and confirm that there''s no hidden meaning. Maybe the user is
        just verifying that I understand basic math. Alright, I''ll go with that.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1768318732,"id":"chatcmpl-tSp9QB6X4RrckqmAGAw9uhfxcw3Qkp3L","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":293,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":255,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":16,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":3},"prompt_tokens_per_second":927.4824647846501,"time_per_output_token_ms":7.866808873720136,"time_to_first_token_ms":17.251,"tokens_per_second":127.1163461642751,"total_tokens":309}}'

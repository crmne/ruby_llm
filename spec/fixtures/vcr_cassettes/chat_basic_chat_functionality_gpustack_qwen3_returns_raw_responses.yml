        capital of France is **Paris**. It is the largest city in the country and
        has been the political, cultural, and economic center of France for centuries.
        Famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame
        Cathedral make Paris a <GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION>ly recognized hub of art, history,
        and innovation.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital
        of France. I need to make sure I have the correct answer. I remember that
        France''s capital is Paris. Let me confirm that. Paris is the largest city
        in France and has been the capital since the 13th century. It''s also known
        for its landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. I should state
        that clearly. The user might be a student or someone just curious. Maybe they
        need this for a test or a conversation. I should keep the answer straightforward
        but also mention a bit about why Paris is significant. No need to overcomplicate
        it. Just the main point: Paris is the capital. Double-checking to avoid any
        mistakes. Yep, that''s right. No other cities are considered the capital.
        So the answer is Paris.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1768318734,"id":"chatcmpl-WB6RTkez58pgD16fjDMb2cbP4Uuomkeb","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":238,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":169,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":15,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":3},"prompt_tokens_per_second":1051.6721587323846,"time_per_output_token_ms":7.814079831932773,"time_to_first_token_ms":14.263,"tokens_per_second":127.97412126677173,"total_tokens":253}}'

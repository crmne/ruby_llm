        the user wants me to call the object_params function with a window that starts

        The function requires a \"window\" object with \"start\" and \"end\" in ISO
        format. The dates provided are already in the correct format. So I need to
        structure the arguments as a JSON object inside the tool_call tags. Let me
        make sure the keys are correct and the dates are properly formatted. Everything
        looks good. Time to include the result within the tool_call.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_39bukk2d","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"object_params","arguments":"{\"window\":{\"end\":\"2025-01-02\",\"start\":\"2025-01-01\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":204,"completion_tokens":180,"total_tokens":384}}

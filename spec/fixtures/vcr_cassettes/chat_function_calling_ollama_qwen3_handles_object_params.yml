        the user wants me to call the object_params tool with a specific window. Let
        me check the function definition. The function requires a \"window\" object
        with start and end dates. The parameters are start and end, both dates.\n\nThe
        user provided start as 2025-01-01 and end as 2025-01-02. I need to structure
        these into the window object. The function''s parameters expect a window with
        those dates. So I''ll create the arguments as a JSON object with the window
        containing start and end. \n\nWait, the function''s parameters are under the
        \"window\" property. So the arguments should be {\"window\": {\"start\": \"2025-01-01\",
        \"end\": \"2025-01-02\"}}. That should fit the required schema. I''ll make
        sure to include that in the tool_call.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_9y7yixth","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"object_params","arguments":"{\"window\":{\"end\":\"2025-01-02\",\"start\":\"2025-01-01\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":182,"completion_tokens":243,"total_tokens":425}}

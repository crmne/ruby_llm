        as ISO strings. The dates provided are in the correct format, so I just need
        to structure them into the parameters. I''ll make sure the keys are exactly
        as specified and the dates are strings. Then, I''ll format the tool_call correctly
        within the XML tags.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_ho7mdkz9","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"object_params","arguments":"{\"window\":{\"end\":\"2025-01-02\",\"start\":\"2025-01-01\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":204,"completion_tokens":175,"total_tokens":379}}

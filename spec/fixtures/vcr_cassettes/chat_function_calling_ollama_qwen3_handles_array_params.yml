        the user wants me to call the array_params tool with the tags [\"red\", \"blue\"]
        and combine them. Let me check the function definition.\n\nThe function array_params
        takes an object with a required \"tags\" array. The tags should be a list
        of strings. The user provided exactly that: an array with \"red\" and \"blue\".
        \n\nI need to structure the tool call correctly. The function name is array_params,
        and the arguments should include the tags array. Since the function''s purpose
        is to combine the tags, I just need to pass the array as specified.\n\nNo
        other parameters are needed because the function only requires \"tags\". So
        the correct tool call is to use the function with the given tags. The response
        should then indicate the combined tags, but the actual combining logic is
        handled by the function. \n\nI''ll format the tool call in JSON inside the
        XML tags as instructed.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_ab9idayh","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"array_params","arguments":"{\"tags\":[\"red\",\"blue\"]}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":168,"completion_tokens":211,"total_tokens":379}}
